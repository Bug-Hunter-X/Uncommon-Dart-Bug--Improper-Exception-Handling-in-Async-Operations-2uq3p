# Uncommon Dart Bug: Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to exception handling in asynchronous operations within Dart. The primary issue lies in the nested `catch` blocks, which might mask the real error source by catching broader exceptions.  This is particularly problematic when dealing with asynchronous code and nested `try-catch` blocks.  The solution addresses this by restructuring the `catch` blocks for better error identification and improved error handling.

## Bug Description
The provided Dart code simulates a network request with the possibility of failure. It utilizes `try-catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions, but due to improperly organized nested `catch` blocks, important details about specific exceptions might be lost. The `catch (e)` block should be a last resort.
